# Seminal Sundays

My wife and I are music nerds, often going through critics' lists of important 
albums, listening to ones we've never heard before. Usually on Sunday mornings. Thus,
Seminal Sundays.

This repo contains code for scraping some of those lists, as well as the lists themselves.

### Example Usage
```
python seminal/pitchfork.py --period=2000s --kind=albums --output=csv >> data/pitchfork/best-albums-2000s.tsv
```
